# Fantasy Playing Cards

Graphic design project bringing you some **`free, generic, hand-illustrated playing cards`** for simple games. It features both finished files ready to print-and-play, as well as all the source materials, that can be reused to create custom designs and game prototypes.

All materials are licensed under [**`cc-by license`**](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) which lets you to **`use and modify`** them as you wish both for **`private and commercial`** purposes aking only for attributing me in return.  I believe that makes it a valuable resource for everyone prototyping their games or wanting to design and print their own playing cards.

## State of the project

Currently the project supports only one card game, but consists of [**`54 illustrations`**](https://github.com/wojtryb/Fantasy-Playing-Cards/tree/main/sprites) all hand-painted and high-resolution. More games and illustrations may come, if there will be demand for it, and the project gets some attention.
