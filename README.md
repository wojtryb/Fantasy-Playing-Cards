# Fantasy Playing Cards

Graphic design project bringing you some free, generic, hand-illustrated playing cards for simple games. It features both finished files ready to print-and-play, as well as all the source materials, that can be reused to create custom designs and game prototypes.

All materials are licensed under [cc-by license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) which lets you to **use and modify** them as you wish both for **private and commercial** purposes aking only for attributing me in return.  I believe that makes it a valuable resource for everyone prototyping their games or wanting to design and print their own playing cards.

## State of the project

Currently the project supports only one card game, but consists of 54 hand-painted illustrations. More games and illustrations may come, if there will be demand for it, and the project gets some attention.
